        From the onset of the pandemic in March of 2020, musicians, like the rest of the world, had their lives turned upside down. No more in-person shows, tours canceled, and artists were disconnected from their fans. Luckily, they were able to develop new ways to share their work to maintain a bond with their audiences through virtual shows and social media. Artists found new ways to keep their music alive, making all the difference to fans throughout quarantine. <br>
        Over the course of the pandemic, individuals had more time to listen to music than ever before. . Fortunately, artists also had a lot of time at home to write new music to deliver to their fans. As things started to open back up again, they were eager to hear music live again; a concept many took for granted before. From both an artist and fan standpoint, concerts would now allow both parties to truly live in the moment and enjoy all that music has to offer. <br>
