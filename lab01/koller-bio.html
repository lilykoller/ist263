    <title>Koller - Bio</title>
<body>My name is Lily Koller. I am a sophomore at Syracuse University studying Public Relations with a minor in Information Management & Technology. I am interested in social media in the entertainment industry. I am currently the Account Supervisor for the Newhouse PR Account for Hill Communications. At Hill Comm, I manage a team of five and produce work across various social media platforms. I have skills in Office360 and the Adobe Creative Cloud. Outside of work, Iâ€™m still constantly on my phone on social media and I love photography. I love to travel and try new things; my dream job would have to incorporate this fluidity. </body>
